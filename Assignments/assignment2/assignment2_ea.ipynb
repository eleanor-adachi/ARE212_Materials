    "### (2) Suppose $y$, $x$ and $u$ are scalar random variables, with $y$ and $x$ observed but $u$ unobserved. Consider the function $h(x) = x^3$; under standard assumptions this satisfies our concerns about measurability, so $\\mathbb{E}(u|x) = 0$ implies $\\mathbb{E}(u x^3) = 0$. Use this last condition to motivate a simple least squares estimator of the regression equation $y = \\alpha + \\beta x + u$. How does this differ from the usual OLS estimator? Why might one prefer one to the other, and under what conditions?\n",
